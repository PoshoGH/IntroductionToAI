I worked for them for about 3 months at the end of 2020 as a sortation associate through an agency and ended up doing the PM shifts. 2/3 of my supervisors were decent and the work was usually 2-3 hours of sameday then miscellaneous other warehouse things, a bit of yard marshall work and the sameday returns while the rest of us opened up teh warehouse floor for night shift. Around christmas I actually got to see what the ""normal"" shifts were like, night shift started earlier (about 6pm) up until christmas and we spent most of the last 2-3 hours of our shift just filling in and carrying on with the returns and just moving bags around.

Shifts are long and fast paced for 10hrs straight. No unplanned breaks (toilet). Your break starts at the workstation then the a 5-10min walk to break room is part of the break. If you have 30min u have more like 10-20. People skip breaks to make up time on work loads for fear of being fired. Same on the way back. They watch you continuosly and have warnings popping up saying your going to slow. Then there's the simple fact that no matter what you do, if you under perform a few times your out the door and in comes the next victim. I wonder why these places are largely staffed with foreign work force? Because they don't know any better conditions.

Also, I have worked as a delivery driver in before (but not for Amazon), and pissing in bottles is a pretty common thing. I actually bought one of those bottles for camping with a wide top (bought from Amazon, of course) and would empty it out at the side of the road.

I've worked in a firm that pushes 3.5 tonne drivers to 16 hour days, 6 days a week.

They phoned & said ""Why are you stationary & this better be good!""
I said ""I'm pi**ing into a bottle in the back of the van because if I take 5 minutes to find loo you freak out!""

I looked into constructive dismissal but because I hadn't done a year I couldn't use that.

2023-10-30T20:15:53Z,"I am an amazon driver, 

Firstly pissing in bottles is the drivers choice, it is not forced, we have plenty of time to go to the toilet, I do, 3 or four times a shift, {weak Bladder} we are paid for 9 hours shift, most drivers want to be finished after 6, as such they don't bother finding a toilet, they just rush through the deliveries. so the pissing in bottles is the drivers problem not amazons. If you do your job, yes you are given a set number of minutes per delivery, but that works out to a 9 hour shift. normally a lot of deliveries are below them minutes, as such I regularly end up with 9 or 10 on some occasions 20+ deliveries ahead of expected, as such have plenty of time to go find and release.

on average you are looking at 140 stops per 9 hours, that's about 3-4 minutes per stop. normally or in most instances, stops are less than 100 yards apart in most cases, some maybe 500 yards down the road. other times a few minutes. but its all worked out.

Working at a standard safe speed, you can get 30+ - 50+ parcels ahead, with ease. that gives you 1 and a half hours toilet, and break if needed.

just people wanting to get finished as soon as possible.

in fact, just to itterate my point, 

i work, do a batch of deliveries (around 30-40) then have a 10 minute break. (this includes toileting if needed) then start again, and i'm done within 7 and a half hours, to 8 and a half.",0.2345,-11,0.027111111

2023-10-30T05:10:03Z,"48:42 ""Drivers using the Amazon Delivery App receive reminders to take breaks throughout the day""

I did a few days temping as a VNA driver at a place a couple of weeks ago. On our induction, the company health and safety boss made us read and sign a document that said that anyone operating trucks on a night shift MUST take a 15-minute break after 2 hours, a 20-minute break after 4 hours and another break after 6 hours. This is to reduce the risk of things like driver fatigue and incidents caused by loss of concentration etc.

Of course when I started in the warehouse and asked about the breaks, it turned out that you get one break after 5 hours because the boss doesn't want to lose time. I said to a couple of them who'd been there a while that they all signed this document, so what can the boss do if you take the breaks. I was told that the boss will just phone the agency and say that he doesn't want you back.

My point is that the company policy can say all sorts of nice things but that doesn't mean that those nice things actually happen. And when questioned about it, the company can just wave their company policy around and say that they've done nothing wrong.

The worst part is that if a VNA driver, for example, pushed a pallet through the racking and killed someone below because of driver fatigue and being unreasonably pressured to cut corners, the company would be in the clear because the company gets the drivers to sign to say that they WILL take the required breaks. If driver fatigue was even partly the cause, the driver wouldn't have a leg to stand on.",-0.4023,-11,-0.0515625

2023-10-29T09:26:45Z,"When I was a driver for amazon, I was doing a delivery and was halfway back to my van when a drunk driver took the front end of my van completely off. I called the police. Then I called my manager at Amazon. His first question was ""are the deliveries damaged?"", followed by ""I don't care what the police or anyone else wants, don't let them take that van anywhere until I've got those parcels back"". They sent another amazon driver to get the parcels, who arrived before the police did, emptied my van, and left.

Another time, my van broke down on a run around an hour into my shift. They sent a driver to get the parcels, and I sat waiting for recovery for seven hours. At 8pm, the recovery showed up and got my van going again. I was then told to go back to the driver that helped me and take all of my deliveries plus 20 of his, and get them delivered. The exact words were ""don't worry about going over your time on the road, all that matters is that nothing comes back""

We used to stand in the yard at amazon and swap stories of things we found to make life at amazon easier. Use an ad-blue bottle instead of a drinks bottle so you can pee more without running out of bottles to pee in. Take a bag with wipes and tissues and either deodorant or blast cans, and if you're caught short, use one of the clear bags they provide for parcels when it's raining, clean yourself up, spray to clear the smell, and find a bin on your route to dispose of it. Sounds ridiculous but when you're on site at 11am, loading at 12 noon, at your first drop for 1pm (when you finally start getting paid), you then have upwards of 250 stops. Multidrops mean you'll be knocking on 300+ doors a day in peak times. You can be out til 10pm and then have management screaming at you to ensure you re-attempt any unsuccessful deliveries from earlier in the day. You take the time to go find a toilet inbetween all that, you lose time. Especially in winter when it's pitch black from 4pm and you're hunting for house numbers in the dark with your head torch on. You lose time, the service provider drops in their stats. Amazon comes down on them for that, so they come down on you, more often than not by ""no longer requiring your services"". You can't appeal it because you're self employed, so you don't get the rights of employed staff - not that they respect those anyway. More often than not you don't even work for Amazon. They give contracts for areas to ""service providers"" - small logistics companies who are given an area and a quota of how many drivers are needed, and they manage you.

That way, if a customer is handed an age verified parcel without verification, it's so far away from Amazon's responsibility that it can never really damage them. You are self employed, your point of contact is a service provider, and that service provider is so distanced from Amazon that they can't even mention them when hiring for them! Check any UK job site for the sheer number of companies hiring for ""Our Biggest Client, the World's Largest Online Retailer!"". So if your four year old gets a knife or your six year old gets a crate of beer, you can bet the driver will be gone over it, maybe even the service provider if there's issues across multiple drivers, but by that point Amazon can simply say it's been dealt with.

They draw you in with promises of nearly ¬£200 a day, sometimes more, but small print the part that says they'll charge you ¬£800 a month for using their van and that, unlike anywhere else that I know of, they send a self employed driver their own invoice, where they tell you what you've worked and how many miles you've done (it's always less, obviously), and then pay you that amount. How many times have you hired a plumber or mechanic where you tell them how much time they've spent on your car or toilet, and how much it cost them to commute to work?

The training, meanwhile, is just a list of all the things they can sack you for along with the incredible advice to ""never be in a position where you have to use reverse gear"". Which is made even better by the fact that their routing usually consists of ""make a U-Turn where possible"" as the first instruction.

Despite everything I've said, it can be a good job as a driver. You see the world, you meet hundreds of new people every day, and if you like driving it can be brilliant, as you often are moved delivery areas after a stretch of time, so one day never truly matches the one before it. 

But you are never far away from all the reminders that you're just four wheels and a route number to them in a long line of people who are just four wheels and a route number. I lasted two years, and I was one of the longest serving drivers there by the time I'd finally had enough.",0.9382,0,0.111508838

2023-10-29T07:07:04Z,"I did quite a lot of work in similar jobs in my late teens and early twenties; order picking / packing / production, and a few stints for Royal Mail during Christmas holidays.  These types of jobs are what they are... back-breaking, soul-destroying stuff. I have huge respect for anyone who makes a living this way.  it may be divisive to say so, but what I saw changed these sorts of jobs was large scale immigration.  Back in the late 90's / early naughties there wasn't the supply of immigrant labour we have come to see in more recent years, and the employers had to find  balance between working conditions, pay, and the realities of those types of jobs in order to keep a stable workforce (reading comments staff retention in these jobs hasn't changed, a 3-4 week turnover typical).  I could earn ¬£21k+/annum picking on night shifts (back then min wage was ¬£3.60/h), had flexibility on shift rotations, in some places I could even choose the hours I worked so long a minimum standard was achieved. Why?  Because that's what was needed to keep bums in seats, to keep enough bodies moving through.  With large-scale immigration came a workforce that would accept lower wages with longer hours and poorer standards, employers capitalised, and it happened fast.. in a couple years it all changed. The last such job I worked was around 2005, 12-hour night shifts in a chicken processing factory for minimum wage, with militant supervisors, and where I needed to tap up an interpreter to speak to anyone because everyone else was Eastern European. Seems to me that those same employers are now in a quandry because that migrant / immigrant workforce isn't as plentiful or have naturalised here in the Uk, and for native folks the lowered working standards and pay don't pass muster. The employers will hold out as long as they can, how many have we seen blaming Brit's as lazy and unwilling to work?  The reality I would suggest is that the golden goose of low-cost immigrant labour was never going to last, and is on the change, and they don't like it because maybe it means they have to wave goodbye to some of those profits to keep a stable workforce.",0.0606,1,0.014726631

2023-10-29T01:53:50Z,"im Coventry born and bred and know the problems my city has faced so many times over the last 60 odd years regarding unemployment. for some reason we have an elephant on our coat of arms, but have adopted the phoenix as our second mascot as it is the mythical bird that comes back to life, just as we have done so many times before. you may also know that 'Ghost town' is our theme song, although the song itself was written about the social downfall of the uk as a whole. but the specials (who wrote, produced and sung the song) are also Coventry born and bred.

i say all this because my city has undergone transformation many times since it was given its royal charter in 1345, including hosting the houses of parliament twice, meaning that we were, at those times, the capital of england. or in other words, my city needs amazon! so whilst pointing at the Coventry branch might seem like the right thing to do, and by all accounts im on your side that we need to form a union to protect the workers, they dont go in there with their eyes closed! there has been so much filmed and written about the poor working conditions at all of these sites, or certainly many of them, as to inform prospective workers of said conditions. however, working brings about self respect, especially for those who have struggled to gain employment for many years. this is what makes those working conditions more bearable for most of those employed, not just in Coventry but other sites throughout the world.

but, having watched the video and all the work you went to to try to bring about change, i can only applaud you for your courage! firstly for getting a job amidst all the pressure you must have felt, especially once you were caught out inside the building and how nervous you must have felt trying to get out of the building. and then to do your very best to bring about even more awareness of the shady practices amazon use to avoid paying taxes, not just in the uk but [again] throughout the world. so well done oobah, you did what few other media stars have been able to do. but next time, please choose somewhere other than Coventry if you want to bring about change. if what you do works, it'll find its way to my city, eventually.........",0.9757,1,0.156528418

2023-10-28T19:59:23Z,"As someone that worked at the Coventry warehouse for about 4-5 months (started about a month before Christmas) around 3 years ago, the place has either drastically changed or the downsides are being oversold for dramatic effect.

The scanners are just metal detectors, which should come as no surprise seeing as it is a warehouse dealing with a lot of easily stolen items, the scanners obviously make this a lot harder (but not impossible üòâ)

Yes your feet hurt, but that's because you're walking around on a solid concrete floor for up to 10 hours a day. Amazon provides basic hard toe boots which obviously aren't going to be the best considering how many people they have to provide them for but you are welcome to bring your own or put comfier insoles in the ones they provide.

In areas where you are likely to be standing for a long time (as opposed areas where you move around a lot such as outbound) thick rubber mats are provided to help minimise the issues that come from standing too long.

Moaning about 'constant surveillance' is idiotic, there isn't some shadowy room with a wall of screens and a team of people watching at all times, they're literally there to get footage to refer back too in the chance that there is an incident such as an accident, theft, fire, assault etc

All of the warehouse issues mentioned are standard issue not just for amazon but for a lot of warehouses in general, some issues can be alleviated or exasperated depending on what the particular warehouse produces/provides, and the issue of sore feet/back/etc. are standard on any physically demanding job.

I had heard people talk about the conditions at amazon warehouses and always told them the Coventry one was sound, assuming it was because it wasn't your usual amazon warehouse (the Coventry warehouse is one of only 2 of its type in Europe, the other being in Germany I believe, that purely deals with supplying other amazon warehouses with its products to then be picked, packed and shipped to customers) but am now wondering whether complaints at other warehouses are also being overblown.

This isn't a defence of Amazon, the other things mentioned in the documentary such as the tax avoidance, lack of age verification and drivers having to piss in bottles are obviously bad and I can't speak on those issues as I don't have first hand experience with any of them but I have worked in the very warehouse featured in the documentary and to me the benefits far outweighed the negatives.",-0.9834,-20,0.055952381

2023-10-28T14:23:19Z,"I spent almost 3 years working as an Order Picker / Process instructor / Waterspider for Amazon. After about 2 years of doing that job which involved either 2300 squats per shift (average) OR about 15 miles of walking, I was suffering quite severe leg pain. I started taking Co-codamol before, during and after each shift. Eventually Co-Codamol wasn't enough and my Doc wouldn't provide anything more powerful, so I started doing 'Cold Water Extraction' of the pills, to remove the paracetamol, and just leave me with pure Codeine. This worked, taking quite massive doses for a while, and seeing as it was a TOTALLY legal drug as far as the the Amazon drugs testing could tell, it wasn't a problem. After putting up with it for another year the pain was too much, and I spoke to HR about it, and their answer was 'It's just the nature of the job', basically, tough titty......I couldn't tolerate the pain and was shaking by the end of each shift. I took them up on their 'Offer' and took the voluntary redundancy package. After leaving Amazon, I was still in intense pain each day, and my Doc still wouldn't provide pain medication (OR a diagnosis), so I found an alternative form of pain relief that meant that I was able to carry on working.....Heroin. For the next 6 years I was an active IV heroin user as a result of what I suspected was nerve damage from the 2300 squats per day. The heroin took the edge off the pain enough so that I was able to function normally. Eventually I managed to cut down on the drug use, but it did take multiple trys, and a stint in a rehab facility at a cost to myself of ¬£4K for a 2 week stay! I was older than optimum for working at Amazon, being 42 when I started. Ideally if you are thinking about a job there, you should be in your late teens or early 20s so that you have the physical resilience to recover from the physical effects of each shift. Once the pain killer use starts to get serious.....GET OUT instead of doing what I did and resorting to stronger and stronger painkillers. Working for Amazon DOES destroy people physically. I'm fairly sure that for some people the hugely repetetive nature of the job could be mentally harmful too. I DO know of people who got fired for taking too many piss breaks. I DO know of one guy who had to walk to the front gate so that he could be seen by paramedics (Amazon security refused to let them in) after he'd had a heart attack. He later died, and his manager phoned him next day to find out why he wasn't in work.

2023-10-28T09:12:48Z,"I spent 3 months over Christmas 2012 with Amazon. I was initially stowing items for around 3 weeks, then I was upgraded to what they called a Sweeper. This was someone who dealt with problems that people stowing had which normally fell into 2 camps. The stowing work involves scanning a trolley which is filled with items. Once scanned, that trolley and all the items on it are assigned to that person. The stower then scans items, scans a shelf and places the item onto the shelf which is a way to manage where the inventory is. The scanner knows how many items are on the trolley so if you scan an item but the scanner thinks there is nothing left on the trolley then there is an issue. Or, you try to scan the trolley at the end of stowing all the items but the scanner thinks there are still items on there, then that is also an issue. Other problems also occurred but by and large, these were the two main issues I had to fix. Normally it meant that someone had made a mistake and it was my responsibility to work out what mistake had been made and who was to blame. When I fixed the issue, I had to assign who was to blame for the mistake which got fed into a central system. The fulfillment centre monitored the mistakes and 3 mistakes in a week meant you were fired. I had inadvertently become a member of the Amazon hit squad on the fulfillment centre floor. Cottoning on to this, and having a conscience, I would ask how many mistakes people had made that week and if they were on 2 already, I would assign the mistake to myself but I could only help 2 people a week. The higher-ups worked out after a couple of weeks what was happening and I was removed as a sweeper and put on a really crappy job involving scanning every item on the floor searching for missing inventory. No-one said it at the time but it felt like a punishment. I lasted 1.5 days of that before leaving. From my limited experience working there, I agree with those who complain about working conditions.",-0.9924,-24,0.110854342

The other week, I bought a LiPo battery charger. For those who aren't aware, LiPos are the ones that get explodey when they're not happy. I thought it hadn't come with a power supply and - as I saw when I looked at some of the reviews - other people who bought it did, too. I was wrong.

In the box, there was a cable. On one end, there was a standard 12V power supply jack. On the other, a pair of crocodile clips. Tucked away deep in the instructions, it said that they expected you to power the charger by hooking it up to the terminals of the battery of your car. Absolute. Lunacy.

EDIT: I forgot - IT GOT WORSE! There was only one cable for the battery end, too! Yet again, crocodile clips. For charging a LiPo.

2023-10-26T19:07:31Z,"The best and easiest way for any of us to do something about this is to simply not use Amazon.
There's been a ban on any product in my household since 2016.
Not one item has been ordered using this company.
For the ordinary workers out there who make up the vast majority of people, its important we stick together however, wherever and whenever we can because make no mistake, this vile company and companies like it are slowly taking over everything.
Soon enough you'll see Amazon painters, Amazon window cleaners, Amazon restaurants, cinemas - u name it, this is the long term plan and I think we all know by now that governments are no friend of the ordinary working man and woman.
In fact, they work directly for the 1% who are managing, slowly but surely to rig the game even further in their favour by installing their people at every single level.
Many key political positions have already been taken over and they're stepping up their greedy self serving campaign by controlling many other key positions within organisations and institutions set up to keep some semblance of 'checks and balances'.
We're seeing it unfold before our very eyes.
Our rights are being eroded as we speak and Amazon is the number one example of how they are doing it and moreover getting away with it.
Every right we have as workers, which we should never forget was fought for by our predecessors who literally died while doing so, is the number one target for these greedy unscrupulous bastards for a complete restructuring and eventual elimination.
People so easily forget that it wasn't that long ago that there was no such thing as a weekend, a 40 hour week, an 8 hour day,  minimum wage, holiday pay, sick pay, time and a half, overtime, lunch breaks etc..
The Victorian era of child labour, slavery in some cases, horrendous working conditions for equally horrendous pay, work houses, terrible discrimination and uncontrolled un-regulated greed wasn't that long ago.
Since then good, decent, intelligent, hard working and hard fighting men and women fought to ensure we had rights under laws which were put in place to protect workers from greedy unscrupulous employers.
How easy we forget this.
There is now a concerted effort, with the convivence of corruptible politicians to crawl back these rights which took so long and much pain and suffering to achieve in the first place.
Every single right we have was not just handed to us, we had to fight tooth and nail for them which many of us now take for granted.
Nearly every single government in the world would scrap them all if they could but its much harder than one would think yet that's exactly what they're doing, by stealth and massive companies such as Amazon are championing this crusade to eradicate ANY sense of fair play, decent wages and practical, decent and fair working practises put there to protect workers and their families.
Our number one weapon as workers is the ability to withdraw our labour so its important to unionise if u can.
Seriously think about it.
As consumers our best weapon is the ability to boycott.
Don't give the bastards a penny or cent of ur hard earned cash.
Give it to the local shops, the smaller business.
Slightly more expensive but essential in the long run if we are to have ANY sort of decent living standards.
Look at the way things are going already with prices going completely off the charts while their yachts get bigger and their bank balance gets sweeter at OUR EXPENSE.
Buying anything from the likes of Amazon is literally buying another nail in the coffin of a decent, just and fair society with proper rights for us all.

Divided we fall....",-0.937,-29,0.084437543
2023-10-26T18:58:28Z,"Just nitpicking a bit re 37m20 secs in...but taxes don't 'pay for everything'. Taxes exist to prevent inflation in a fractional reserve system. Money is issued in the form of loans by high street banks and also by government itself via the central bank. Too much money issuance without reeling some back in the form of taxes loses confidence in the monetary system and ergo you get inflation and your currency loses unit value. Money is debt, debt is money :)
Taxation and interest rates are what control the inflation.
Its economics 101 and something everyone really ought to know but apparently even many MP's are completely clueless about it. If taxes 'paid' for things then we would be using a gold/silver system and you would have a limit to the amount in circulation.
Really what corporations are doing with tax dodging is moving the tax burden onto ordinary people who have to make up the revenue needed for covering national debt (central bank issuance) or loss of services due to austerity as the alternative for example.
Theres a lot more to it than this and you can read all about it but Amazon are small fry in this game, there are literally tens of trillions sat offshore untaxed. Whenever the 'magic money tree' or 'tax pays for stuff' comes up in discussion I get triggered everytime :p",-0.9192,-14,0.034411765

I worked for Amazon for a year and it got to the point where my knees were knackered from all the kneeling down to count the bottom rows of boxes that the robots would bring me. Instead of seeing to my issues they forced me around and messed me about and brought me into meetings where they tried to do anything but give me acceptable conditions to work under.

They sent me from HR to managers back to HR 7 times over trying to pawn off the responsibility of my condition and so I just quit on the spot. The people there treat you like a number and you're worked to death. I remember being written up because I took a minute longer than was acceptable using the restroom.

That day i remember i wasnt finished until 7pm and that last delivery eventually led me home at 9pm.. I started looking for another job after that..

My wages weren't adding up even though i was on Something like 120 stops...  for ¬£120 a day

I got told its 6 days a week; and i had to lease a van. So after a month i worked out I was working slightly below the minimum wage..

Pretty shocking there is no age identification at Amazon especially in the current climate. Things are definitely not good for Amazon workers but their Prime customers aren't much better off nowadays. Amazon deliveries are left in the street and complaints get ignored. Amazon 'free to me' videos are either B Movies or old, and the Freeview listings - with adverts - are increasing.

And unlike China people get a choice to work for Amazon (Many families in China work for the same bad companies for generations). If you want a job and you get one at Amazon and don't like it, leave.

 Also this video is breaking YT's T&Cs by using children to use and hold offensive weapons, I mean if want to be all morally correct after all, this video shows children how to obtain knives like a 'how to'....... Sooooooooooo.

Regarding tax, they pay what they should pay within the law, tax isn't a moral obligation it's a lawful one. If you don't pay what you should under the law you are fined. If someone is smart enough to get around paying what you morally think they should pay then good on them, that's capitalism. We all wish we could pay less tax. If you think Amazon should pay more then it's the governments fault, both sides, that allow these loop holes to remain in place!

They told you the app we use tells us to take breaks... it asks us once per shift after about 4 hours and there is a button that will allow you to skip the break and work though with no break and most of the time you have to do because you dont have time for a break when you have ""180 stops"" that 180 disregars the multi-stops which is multiple delivers in 1 stop which is amazons way of justifying sending over 300 sometimes even 400 parcels out per van per day ""well you've only have 160 stops"" yes but I've had 368 parcels and can move in the back of my van to find the parcels. The vans are often packed out and are unsafe to be in the back of, I know of 3 drivers for my team alone that have been injured from stuff falling on them in the back of the van, any workplace injuries as a driver are looked at as a driver problem because we are ""self-employed"", any time of as a result of an injury is unpaid. You are told to bring back any parcels that can't be safely delivered to the customer or their safe space but then penalised for bringing parcels back. The DSP ""manager"" spends all their time in the DSP office of the depot ripping the drivers apart for being ""fat"" or ""lazy"" I've heard homophobic and sexist remarks and it's just laughed off because ""self-employed"". And the list goes on. But just to add the cherry on the cake, 90% of the prime branded vans are not fit for road use with knocks and bangs heard in almost all of them, they are dangerous. And we have to deal with all of this for ¬£99 per day less tax that we have to sort out ourselves because you guessed it ""self-employed"" I could go on but what's the point.",-0.9528,-24,0.070634921

I would also like to add that we do indeed have a notification pop up in the middle of our shift to take a break. The breaks last only 20 minutes, and the place i deliver, has no toilet for miles. 

If we were to take that time to use the toilet, we would be behind on the overwhelming load of deliveries we need to make.

Also if we don't get the time to make all the deliveries we have for thet day, and bring the parcels back to the warehouse, we have a points system that goes into the negative which could lead into a dismissal. 

The ironic thing is, the best plastic bottle to use on shift is called ""Prime"" because it has a wide lid and you cannot see the contents of the bottle.

We also have a lot of problems with the warehouse being behind and our satnav/work app always having problems, which can lead to us being behind again.

Short story short, as I was just inside of a six month probationary period... They sacked me. I cried like a baby, unapologetically as the seizure I had suffered was due to me coming off of a medication which I was undergoing tests for to ensure other things weren't at play.

2023-10-24T16:13:15Z,"I walked around 15-20 miles a shift there and I did it 4 days on 3 days off. I bought airmax shoes, had insoles the lot. I still needed those 3 days to rest my legs and feet. I used to use my trolley like a pensioners walker because my feet were so fucked from the concrete floors. It was the height of summer so it was 100% humidity with an average temperature of around 25 Celsius. We HAD to wear facemasks. I had to drink water constantly. I got a warning for using the toilet any other time than my break time. All workers ignored eachother like drones. There was no point acknowledging anyone because if you stopped for more than 45 seconds to say anything to a colleague or help a colleague out the gestapo would come and quiz you and berate you. The manager had a screen so if you are more than a minute or so between picks you flag up as red and they come get you. Another thing was because each pick was around a minute or so each you felt after doing 100 picks time had passed. I think once I seen time go backwards. I have never felt the passage of time appear to go so slowly. The only and i mean ONLY good thing because I wasn't contracted or entitled to holidays I got time back. Half a shift for every week worked. Sometimes they would have less to do so they would message your device saying you can go home. Even tho it's terrible you have no holiday allowance leaving that place early was an absolute gift every time. When I did my final shift I tried to feel nostalgia and take it in and remember my time there positively. I told myself I was going to finish my whole last shift and get all the pay I could get. I lasted 4 hours of my last shift and i really had to push to manage that. I walked down to my rep and told him with a big smile on my face I'm off.

2023-10-24T15:50:47Z,"I've not worked at amazon but I have dealt with their listing product systems, and WOW it is annoying.

You didn't even go into how both amazon and ebay don't really allow you to sell on their site as an individual business. I mean you can do it, it's just the way the system is set up is that you don't really have a visible unique identity beyond whatever paperwork you put into the parcel order sent to the customers home. To the average joe they will just think they're just ordering from amazon.

This also brings up another issue:

When you do a good job? Amazon takes credit for your services in terms of the public eye

When you do a bad job? Suddenly everything is your fault and they might even threaten to remove you from the platform for making them look bad

For example: if you sell a hair color product, amazon not only puts every seller of that product under the same listing, but if their information is out of date? You can't change it only amazon can! So then you have to deal with refund complaints like ""the hair color box is not the same as the one shown online""",-0.7384,1,0.0275

I was drug and alcohol swabbed before my shift and also told that I would be randomly tested during some other point in my employment.
I got metal detected and patted down when going on breaks or leaving.

12 hour shifts and you're not allowed to sit down, i got back problems and knee problems after a month.

Bonuses are promised for good work during the christmas period, but they're rarely given to anyone other than the managers. They will find ways to disqualify you such as going to the toilet for more than a minute, not being ""up to their standards"" and other bullshit excuses, usually disqualifying you a couple of days before Christmas after you've worked your ass off for a month straight.

The business is incredibly unorganized and sign in systems regularly don't work. I have seen at least 20 of my coworkers not get payed for their 12 hour shifts simply because the sign in system was fault and the company ""couldn't prove the staff member was working that day"" and so therefore ""cannot be paid"". Only a few staff were notified of the fault in the system and therefore the majority didn't get payed. The companies response? ""well you should have asked"".

Managers bully the staff. There's definitely a ""lads"" culture among them. They talk to you like second class citizens.


The warehouse floor is surrounded by a metal fence so you can't leave without a manager letting you out. Very prison-like.

No mental stimulation whatsoever. Phones are banned on the floor and talking is looked down on. You're doing the same repetitive task again and again all day under heavy LED lights and the mental boredom started giving me depression after just a month.

Eventually i was let go on no notice, with no warning, and i was simply called 2 hours before my next shift that I was no longer wanted in the company for ""not meeting their productivity standards"", and even though I am upset about losing my income on zero notice, I am also eternally grateful that I never have to go back to that prison again.",-0.9918,-19,-0.010677083

I have also observed that the above companies take up the entire search list and one has to scroll all the way down repeatedly in order to see other companies selling similar products (e.g. you get 50 suggested products of which only one or two other companies appear and the rest is just Amazon, Temu, Ebay. Amazon even keeps bringing the same product up again and again after you scroll down to check for variety. It also does not show you prices near that products but at least two times higher so that they can lock your interest into buying that particular product! In a way, online shopping is already a monopoly and its not around customer needs but a creation of an addictive shopping culture. Look at the average American filling up their homes and garage spaces with online purchases. I hope for more smaller independent companies to sell online with their own delivery systems. Let's be honest nobody maintains their quickly-made wealth overtime without blocking or lobbying against smaller companies. All they do all day is hiring lawyers and accountants on how to do unethical, illegal things that can be overlooked by current legislation!",0.9069,3,0.025198413

The legality of removing rocks and sand from the banks of the River Thames in England, United Kingdom, can be divided into two main aspects: the protection of geological features and the ownership of the riverbed.

1. Protection of Geological Features:  The preservation of unique ecosystems and geological features is a key aspect of the River Thames' protection. As such, it is illegal to remove any natural resources such as rocks, sand, or plants from national parks, including the riverbed 15. 

2. Ownership of Riverbed:  If the riverbed is on private property, then it is legal to remove rocks and sand without permission 3.  However, it's worth noting that even on private property, the riverbed may still be protected as a part of the larger ecosystem 1.",0.1901,-3,-0.04702381

Targets are ridiculously easy to achieve, we have some elderly associates that beat most 20 year olds in productivity and they're fine. 
Also people do steal, i caught someone stealing myself and also there's always stories of people stealing from time to time. That's why there's monitoring of everyone. But to be honest I never felt being watched. There's cameras everywhere but it doesn't make any difference because if something goes wrong or if there's an accident, there's evidence and I can't be wronged for anything because I did everything right. 
Not everything is perfect, in my time in 2 different sites I met some terrible managers and team leads and few rotten eggs that really put company to shame. Long term good employees need more appreciating and those who take a piss need sacking at faster rate.

2023-10-23T17:29:40Z,"Personally I think we're too spoiled in this country - those conditions are nirvana compared to how some work around the world, and even here in the UK. Amazon still suck and they need to put some of their ludicrous profit into paying their staff better, but it could be a lot worse. Try landscape gardening in summer if you want your back and feet hurting, or working on an oil rig, or going out to sea on a trawler - back breaking jobs all of them, and that's not even mentioning vocations that take a toll on your mental health like being a social worker, or jobs where your safety is at risk on a daily basis like a copper, fireman or prison warden.

I'd happily do 10 hours in an Amazon factory over quite a few jobs I did in the '90s for the grand old sum of ¬£1 an hour. The way this doc goes on you'd think it was some sweat shop where people are living, sleeping briefly and then doing 16-20 hours a day under duress.

It's bad, but have some context. There's billions of people on this planet doing harder work in worse conditions for a pittance - ironically enough, most of the stuff they're producing and manufacturing will be going through these warehouses on their way to people's homes.

Definitely a first world issue - these folk will be earning at least ¬£400 a week for this 'nightmare job' - that's the annual salary for some, and judging by the accents of a lot of the people, they're from such countries originally. They could always take their back problems back there and see if there's a NHS equivalent available for free to fix it?

I bet the people of Gaza right now would swap places with these poor souls having to do a hard day's work for a decent wage so they can go home to their decent home in a country they're not even born in yet welcome them - that's a far cry from being in an open prison, getting bombed and having all your utilities turned off ain't it.

Again, we're too soft in this country. You could show this video in countries like China, Nigeria, North Korea etc and the people would be in hysterics at how 'bad' the conditions are.",-0.9581,-20,0.052380952

2023-10-23T14:08:13Z,"Nothing from this video comes as remotely surprising.
Large corporations aren't large because they're nice. Amazon isn't the only one. Disney operates child labour sweatshops in third world countries. Starbucks workers are super happy, right? Remember when X fired people through an e-mail? Unfortunately, these conditions are terrible, but that's why they look for desperate people, because they know you don't have a backup and can't afford to not accept their terrible conditions.
Tax evasion is just common practise for any decently sized business. I'm no genius, I don't work in a large company, and even I know the basics of it, let alone these multi-billionaires with a plethora of lawyers behind them looking for every loophole for them to jump through. It's basically like the video describes, set up a company in a tax haven country where they don't charge tax, anything you sell is ""bought"" via this company and sold at the price you ""bought"" it an voila, zero profit in the actual country operated in. British Virgin Islands and Monaco are pretty common as well besides the ones already named. If you're thinking, ""well, this needs to be changed."" No, it won't be. The moment you threaten to close this loophole, all these companies will leave, and they absolutely will because they have done so in the past. That means you still don't get to tax them, they're not losing out in sales more than you are in their service and employment. And then there's a massive employment gap that can't be filled in, meaning more people on the dole and benefits, meaning more burden on the economy, meaning less productivity, meaning it just won't happen because the government can't handle it. Large corporations will ALWAYS leverage their hiring numbers to get this advantage.
HMRC can jump on your back if you paid ¬£10.00 less on your PAYE because you have no leverage over them, but they can't do a thing against the likes of these corporations. That's why the rich get richer.",0.8837,-1,0.02406994

Is my experience, Amazon drivers can‚Äôt even be bothered to go to my front door and deliver the item, but instead leave it out in the open for anyone to steal. I‚Äôm sure people are familiar with Hermes drivers literally throwing packages.

Sorry to say, but just don‚Äôt feel that truly sorry for the delivery drivers - it‚Äôs a low skill role, so you‚Äôre assessed on output, in this case volume of parcels delivered. If don‚Äôt like the role, simply change your job.

2023-10-23T03:32:18Z,"Was an Amazon driver myself for 11 months a few years ago and I can honestly say, the conditions were pretty damn good. 
We had 9 hour routes, which most people finished quicker and as we were paid on a daily route/shift basis, meant we were incentivized to finish quicker. 

The routes I did, which were a mixture of rural, semi-rural and built up towns etc, all had plenty of opportunities for me to take toilet breaks, in supermarkets, fuel stations, fast food outlets etc and never once, was I ‚Äúforced‚Äù to urinate in a bottle !!! 

I did however, see drivers that used bottles to urinate in, rather than choosing to stop somewhere more suitable and they all made that choice, just to get finished quicker than the allotted 9 hour route. 

That was a choice that they made and not forced on them and to be honest, they were dirty, filthy individuals, who threw bottles of urine out the window of their vans, or threw them in the back of their vans, rather than disposing them properly !!!

Who in their right mind does that and thinks it‚Äôs ok ??? 

I was in my early 50s when I started as a driver and in my group of 40-50 drivers, about 30% of them, chose to be lazy sods and pee In bottles, whereas the rest of us, had a bit more dignity and maturity, choosing to use all the available options open to us. 

Even businesses that I regularly delivered to and office blocks, would all allow me the opportunity to use their toilet facilities. 

If you don‚Äôt believe me, then ask the next Amazon driver you meet, to show you his route on his map (in your area) and you will immediately see all the local businesses, fast food outlets, supermarkets, council buildings etc, etc, where toilet facilities are available and available to use. 

Ask him or her, if they plan their toilet breaks each day, according yo the availability on their route ? 

An honest driver will tell you they do and a lazy sod, will tell you that he/she has to use a bottle. 

Ps, every female driver used available toilet facilities on routes, with only male drivers being the lazy culprits of the infamous piss bottles.",0.9398,3,0.105094131

Of course there's high security in a warehouse where people can steal thing's, let alone it being Amazon with a high volume of goods being processed. Camera's? like in every single shop you mean? scary stuff. Peeing in bottles on the road is normal and if you have any semblance of a brain you would plan out on your route where you can pee quickly. Maybe also don't flag people down and interrupt their shifts, and then suggest they are pressed for time lol. Turned off when it was about selling bottles of pee which is gross/probably fake. Amazon is not a career job, it's a get in, get out quickly type of hustle with an ever rotating number of people working.
